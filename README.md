# Introduction
HerbiTraits is a functional trait dataset that contains functional traits of all large-bodied, terrestrial, mammalian herbivores that lived during the last 130,000 years (n = 511 species). It is based on PHYLACINE V1.2 taxonomy and root traits, but provides more detailed trait information for the for the species of interest. It includes data on: 

* Body Mass
* Diet
* Fermentation Type
* Habitat Use
* Limb Morphology

Each of these traits is fundamental to the ecological impact that large herbivores have on terrestrial ecosystems. Trait data were compiled from 231 sources and represent the best available knowledge on the functional traits of late Quaternary herbivorous mammals. As such, HerbiTraits provides a tool for the analysis of herbivore functional diversity both past and present, and their  effects on ecosystem dynamics.

# Downloading the data
The HerbiTraits dataset is available on [Figshare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) as well as [Github](https://github.com/ejlundgren/herbiTraits.git).
<br>

# Using the data
HerbiTraits consists of an Excel spreadsheet containing metadata (column names and descriptions), the trait dataset, and references as three separate sheets. The dataset is open-access.

# Updates
We aim to maintain HerbiTraits with the best available data and to incorporate other ecologically relevant traits in the future. We urge users to report errors or updates on newly published data, to use for correction or integration into HerbiTraits. Corrections can be sent to *EMAIL@email.com*
