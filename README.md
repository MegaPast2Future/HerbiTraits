READ ME FOR THE HERBITRAITS TRAIT DATASET
================

# Introduction

HerbiTraits is a functional trait dataset that contains functional
traits of all large-bodied (≥10 kg), terrestrial, avian and mammalian
herbivores that lived during the last 130,000 years (n = 545 species).
The mammalian component of the dataset is based on PHYLACINE V1.2
taxonomy and root traits, but we have provided more detailed trait
information for the species of interest. The avian component has been
added by the authors of HerbiTraits. HerbiTraits includes data on:

  - Body Mass
  - Diet
  - Fermentation Type
  - Habitat Use
  - Limb Morphology

Each of these traits is fundamental to the ecological impact that large
herbivores have on terrestrial ecosystems. Trait data were compiled from
557 sources and represent the best available knowledge on the functional
traits of late Quaternary herbivorous mammals. As such, HerbiTraits
provides a tool for the analysis of herbivore functional diversity both
past and present, as well as their effects on ecosystem dynamics. <br>

# Downloading the data

The HerbiTraits dataset is hosted on
[Figshare](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) as well as
[Github](https://github.com/ejlundgren/herbiTraits.git). <br>

# Using the data

HerbiTraits consists of an Excel spreadsheet containing metadata, the
trait dataset, and references as three separate sheets. The dataset is
open-access. For detailed information on the metadata, please see the
[original publication](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) in
*Scientific Data*. <br>

# Citing the data

When using these data, please cite:

*Lundgren, E.J., Schowanek, S.D., Middleton, O., Davis, M., Ramp,

avian and mammalian herbivores. (In Review, Nature Scientific Data).*

# Updates

We aim to maintain HerbiTraits with the best available data and to
incorporate other ecologically relevant traits in the future. We urge
users to report errors or updates on newly published data, to use for
correction or integration into HerbiTraits. You can send us your
corrections by filling in [the following
