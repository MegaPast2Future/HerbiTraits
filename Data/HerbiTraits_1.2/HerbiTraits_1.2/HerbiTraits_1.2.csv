However, all extant sloth species are foregut fermenters (Clauss 2004 Mammal Review). Fermentation type is a conservative trait, and extant two-toed and three-toed sloth species are more closely related to various of the now-extinct ground sloths than they are to each other (Pujos et al. 2012 Journal of Mammalian Evolution; Presslee et al. 2019 Nature Ecology and Evolution). Foregut fermentation is either the ancestral fermentation type of all sloth species, or it evolved at least twice in distinct (extant) sloth lineages. The most parsimonious fermentation type for extinct sloths would thus be foregut fermentation. However, Megatheriids pose a biological anamoly as there are no foregut fermentation species known at those body sizes (largest known was Sivatherium, a giraffid at 1250 kg). Vizcaino et al. 2006 and Clauss et al. 2003 suggests therefore that the extremely large Megatheriid sloths (Genera Megatherium and Eremotherium) may have been hindgut fermenters.

By doing so they documented a mixed diet of C3 and C4 vegetation and that Diprotodon migrated, likely in groups over ~200km. However, C4 in this region could be Atriplex, instead of grass. Indeed, the Australian Musem 2020 mentions Atriplex found in the abdominal region of a specimen, in what appears to be a fossilized stomach (primary source not reported). Grocket 1997 likewise found a mixed C3/C4 diet. Webb 2009 describes Diprotodons as mixed feeders of grasses and browse, citing Grocke 1997. Unfortunately, there appears to be little empirical evidence to differentiate between Atriplex and grass consumption as the driver of the C4 isotopes. Other authors, such as Johnson and Prideaux 2004, classify Diprotodons as browsers. DeSantis 2017 concurs with isotope results that Diprotodon was a mixed feeder of C3/C4, and finds that their microwear patterns are similar to swamp wallabies, suggesting a variable but browse-heavy diet. Sharp and Rich (2016) report on unusually strong bite height forces as evidenced by skull morphology. These could indicate a diet of extremely tough, high fiber vegetation, a habit of digging with canines, or potential sexual selection (e.g. fighting with canines).

Thus this system maximizes material flow and rate of fermentation at the expense of cell wall digestion. The implications of this is that food intake rates are less limited in macropods than in ruminants when foraging high fiber foods: as forage quality decreases ruminants reduce consumption rate (because they require longer fermentation times on high fiber foods), whereas macropod intake rate remains more or less constant.","Hume 2002 Acta Zoologica Sinica; Dawson et al. 1989 Fauna of Australia","Digitigrade","Observed Genus",3,"Kubo et al. 2019 report plantigrade, which is true while foraging/standing.

Extant kangaroos posssess foregut fermentation systems, but instead of them being divided into sacs, they are linear and have higher throughputs - comparable in function to hindgut colon fermentation in fact. Thus this system maximizes material flow and rate of fermentation at the expense of cell wall digestion. The implications of this is that food intake rates are less limited in macropods than in ruminants when foraging high fiber foods: as forage quality decreases ruminants reduce consumption rate (because they require longer fermentation times on high fiber foods), whereas macropod intake rate remains more or less constant.","Hume 2002 Acta Zoologica Sinica","Digitigrade","Observed Genus",3,"Like Macropus kangaroos, Protemnodon could be considered plantigrade or digitigrade.

Extant kangaroos posssess foregut fermentation systems, but instead of them being divided into sacs, they are linear and have higher throughputs - comparable in function to hindgut colon fermentation in fact. Thus this system maximizes material flow and rate of fermentation at the expense of cell wall digestion. The implications of this is that food intake rates are less limited in macropods than in ruminants when foraging high fiber foods: as forage quality decreases ruminants reduce consumption rate (because they require longer fermentation times on high fiber foods), whereas macropod intake rate remains more or less constant.","Hume 2002 Acta Zoologica Sinica","Unguligrade","Observed Genus",3,"Monodactyl hoof-like unguligrade, convergent on 'open-plains horses', suggesting a cursorial form of locomotion.
