Water.Dependence,"Free water dependence. Some species can extract water from their food, others require 'free water'. ""None"" = A species that obtains all water from forage or has specialized adaptations that allow the species to go long periods without free water; ""Low"" = A species that requires free water, especially during certain life stages (e.g. while lactating) but can go intermittent periods without; ""High"" = A species that requires free water on regular intervals, and whose distribution is strongly shaped by surface water availability. Free water dependence is based on Hempson et al. 2015, but was modified for the 'Low' category.","""None"", ""Low"", ""High""",Categorical

Rooting,"Binary variable indicating whether the species roots, using mouth, face, or tusks, to consume underground food resources.",0 / 1,Binary
