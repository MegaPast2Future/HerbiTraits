Indeed, the Australian Musem 2020 mentions Atriplex found in the abdominal region of a specimen, in what appears to be a fossilized stomach (primary source not reported). Grocket 1997 likewise found a mixed C3/C4 diet. Webb 2009 describes Diprotodons as mixed feeders of grasses and browse, citing Grocke 1997. Unfortunately, there appears to be little empirical evidence to differentiate between Atriplex and grass consumption as the driver of the C4 isotopes. Other authors, such as Johnson and Prideaux 2004, classify Diprotodons as browsers. DeSantis 2017 concurs with isotope results that Diprotodon was a mixed feeder of C3/C4, and finds that their microwear patterns are similar to swamp wallabies, suggesting a variable but browse-heavy diet.
