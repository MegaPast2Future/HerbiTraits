"1","Binomial","Mammalian scientific names correspond to PHYLACINE v1.2.1 (Faurby et al. 2018) and the IUCN Redlist Version 2016-3 (2016). Avian taxonomy was based on most recent peer-reviewed literature. Post-domestic species are named with their post-domestic subspecies epithet (Groves and Grubb 2011 John Hopkins University Press). E.g. post-domestic donkeys are Equus_africanus_asinus, while their pre-domestic ancestors are Equus_africanus.","545 binomial names","Categorical"
